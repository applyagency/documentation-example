# Documentation example

In this repo we deploy [Storybook](https://applyagency.github.io/documentation-example/storybook) and results of all [Playwright](https://applyagency.github.io/documentation-example/playwright) tests to the docs folder. The docs folder is used for our Github Pages domain and can be viewed at https://applyagency.github.io/documentation-example/.

> This is just an example and should not be used in production but used as an inspiration to how the workflow is done. Deploying to the main branch each time a new commit is made is not recommended.
